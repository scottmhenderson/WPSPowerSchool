<p>Laboratory investigations are imbedded in Shrewsbury High School science, technology and engineering classes.  You may be using chemicals and or equipment that can cause serious harm to yourself or others if not used correctly while under the watchful eye of an instructor.  SAFETY for yourself, your classmates and your teacher, is the top priority in every laboratory setting. To ensure a safe lab environment, the following rules must be followed at all times.  Students who violate these rules, or misbehave in a way that results in unsafe conditions, will be subject to one or more of the following consequences (in addition to any other disciplinary action outlined in this handbook): immediate removal from the laboratory, teacher detention, a failing grade for that investigation, removal from future lab activities, and/or dismissal from the course.</p>
<h2>General Rules</h2>
<ol>
<li>Conduct yourself in a responsible manner at all times in the laboratory. 
<li>Read and understand all procedures thoroughly before you begin any experiment. Follow all written and verbal instructions carefully. If you do not understand directions or procedures, ask the instructor before proceeding. 
<li>No student may work in the laboratory without an instructor present. 
<li>Never touch any equipment, chemicals, or other materials in the laboratory area until you are instructed to do so.  Set up only the prescribed apparatus as directed by your instructions or your teacher. 
<li>Do not eat food, drink beverages, or chew gum in the laboratory. Do not use laboratory glassware as containers for food or beverages. 
<li>Perform only those experiments authorized by the instructor. Never do anything in the laboratory that is not called for in the laboratory procedures or by your instructor. 
<li>Never fool around in the laboratory. Horseplay, practical jokes, and pranks are dangerous and prohibited. 
<li>Maintain a clean and tidy workstation.  Bring only relevant materials to the lab area (instructions, data sheets, worksheets).  Other materials should be kept away from the lab.
<li>Keep aisles clear. Push your chair or stool under the desk or bench when not in use. 
<li>Know the locations and operating procedures of all safety equipment including the first aid kit, eyewash station, safety shower, fire extinguisher, and fire blanket. Know where the fire alarm and the exits are located. 
<li>Always work in a well-ventilated area. Use the fume hood when working with volatile substances or poisonous vapors. Never place your head into the fume hood. 
<li>Be alert and proceed with caution at all times in the laboratory. Notify the instructor immediately of any unsafe conditions you observe. 
<li>Dispose of all chemical waste properly. Never mix chemicals in sink drains. Sinks are to be used only for water and those solutions designated by the instructor. Solid chemicals, metals, matches, filter paper, and all other insoluble materials are to be disposed of in the proper waste containers, not in the sink. 
<li>Keep hands away from face, eyes, mouth and body while using chemicals or preserved specimens. Wash your hands with soap and water after per- forming all experiments. Clean all work surfaces and apparatus at the end of the experiment. Return all equipment clean and in working order to the proper storage area. 
<li>Experiments must be personally monitored at all times. You will be assigned a laboratory station at which to work. Do not wander around the room, distract other students, or interfere with the laboratory experiments of others. 
<li>Students are never permitted in the science storage rooms or preparation areas unless given specific permission by their instructor. 
<li>If there is a fire drill during a laboratory period; containers must be closed, gas valves turned off, fume hoods turned off, and any electrical equipment turned off. 
<li>Handle all living organisms used in a laboratory activity in a humane manner. Preserved biological materials are to be treated with respect and disposed of properly. 
<li>When using knives and other sharp instruments, always carry with tips and points pointing down and away. Always cut away from your body. Never try to catch falling sharp instruments. Grasp sharp instruments only by the handles. 
</ol>
<h2>Clothing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Any time chemicals, heat, or glassware are used, students must wear laboratory goggles. 
<li>Contact lenses should not be worn in the laboratory unless you have permission from your instructor. 
<li>Long hair must be tied back and dangling jewelry and loose or baggy clothing must be secured. Shoes must completely cover the foot. No sandals allowed. 
<li>Lab aprons are available for your use at any time during a laboratory activity.  They must be worn when specifically instructed to do so. 
</ol>
<h2>Accidents and Injuries</h2>
<ol>
<li>Report any accident or injury to the instructor immediately, no matter how trivial it may appear. 
<li>If a chemical splashes in your eye(s) or on your skin, immediately flush with running water from the eyewash station or safety shower for at least 20 minutes. Notify the instructor immediately. 
<li>Notify the instructor immediately if any equipment or apparatus does not appear to be functioning properly. 
<li>Report damaged electrical equipment immediately. Look for things such as frayed cords, exposed wires, and loose connections. Do not use damaged electrical equipment. 
<li>If something spills or breaks, notify the instructor immediately and await instruction for proper handling and disposal of materials.
<li>Never handle broken glass with your bare hands. Use a brush and dustpan to clean up broken glass. Place broken or waste glassware in the designated glass disposal container. 
</ol>
<h2>Handling Chemicals</h2>
<ol>
<li>All chemicals are to be considered dangerous. Do not touch, taste, or smell any chemicals unless specifically instructed to do so. The proper technique for smelling chemical fumes will be demonstrated to you. 
<li>Check the label on chemical bottles twice before removing any of the contents. Take only as much chemical as you need. 
<li>Never return unused chemicals to their original containers. 
<li>When transferring reagents from one container to another, hold the containers away from your body. 
<li>Acids must be handled with extreme care. Always add acid to water, swirl or stir the solution and be careful of the heat produced, particularly with sulfuric acid. 
<li>Never remove chemicals or other materials from the laboratory area. 
<li>Take great care when transporting acids and other chemicals from one part of the laboratory to another. Hold them securely and walk carefully. 
</ol>
<h2>Handling Glassware and Equipment</h2>
<ol>
<li>If you do not understand how to use a piece of equipment, ask the instructor for help. 
<li>Carry glass tubing, especially long pieces, in a vertical position to minimize the likelihood of breakage and injury. 
<li>Always lubricate glassware before attempting to insert it in a stopper. Always protect your hands with towels or cotton gloves when inserting glass tubing into, or removing it from, a rubber stopper. If a piece of glassware becomes "frozen" in a stopper, take it to your instructor for removal. 
<li>When removing an electrical plug from its socket, grasp the plug, not the electrical cord. Hands must be completely dry before touching an electrical switch, plug, or outlet. 
<li>Examine glassware before each use. Never use chipped or cracked glassware. Never use dirty glassware. 
<li>Do not immerse hot glassware in cold water; it may shatter. 
</ol>
<h2>Heating Substances</h2>
<ol>
<li>Exercise extreme caution when using a gas burner. Take care that hair, clothing and hands are a safe distance from the flame at all times. Do not put any substance into the flame unless specifically instructed to do so. Never reach over an exposed flame. 
<li>Never leave a lit burner unattended. Never leave anything that is being heated or is visibly reacting unattended. Always turn the burner or hot plate off when not in use. 
<li>When heating liquids in a test tube do not point the open end at yourself or anyone else.
<li>Heated metals and glass remain very hot for a long time. They should be set aside to cool and picked up with caution. Use tongs or heat-protective gloves if necessary. 
<li>Never look directly into a container that is being heated. 
<li>Do not place hot apparatus directly on the laboratory desk. Always use an insulating pad. Allow plenty of time for hot apparatus to cool before touching it.
